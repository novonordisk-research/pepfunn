List of failed rules identified by number. The rule ids are explained at the end of the report.
###########################################
A total of 1 solubility rules failed. The rules id(s) are: 1.
A total of 1 synthesis rules failed. The rules id(s) are: 10.
###########################################

The higher the number of rules violated, the lower the probability to be solubilized or synthesized experimentally (https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/SolyPep/).

- List of solubility rules violations:
1. Discard if the number of charged and/or of hydrophobic amino acids exceeds 45%
2. Discard if the absolute total peptide charge at pH 7 is more than +1
3. Discard if the number of glycine or proline is more than one in the sequence
4. Discard if the first or the last amino acid is charged
5. Discard if any amino acid represents more than 25% of the total sequence

- List of synthesis rules violations:
6. Discard if 2 prolines are consecutive
7. Discard if the motifs DG and DP are present in the sequence
8. Discard if the sequences ends with N or Q residues
9. Discard if there are charged residues every 5 amino acids
10. Discard if there are oxidation-sensitive amino acids (M, C or W)
